MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet and a gateway to blockchain-based decentralized applications (dApps). It is commonly used for managing Ethereum-based tokens and interacting with smart contracts on Ethereum and other compatible blockchain networks. Below is a concise overview of what MetaMask is and how it functions:

Key Features of MetaMask
Wallet Functionality

Allows users to store, send, and receive Ethereum (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens.
Can also store NFTs (ERC-721 and ERC-1155).
dApp Interaction

Acts as a bridge to decentralized applications, enabling you to connect securely without sharing private keys.
Browser Extension & Mobile App

Available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave.
A mobile version is available for iOS and Android.
Network Support

Supports Ethereum by default but can be configured for other networks like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Avalanche.
Key Management

Generates and stores private keys locally on your device.
Access to your wallet is protected by a password, and the seed phrase is required for recovery.

How MetaMask Works
As a Wallet:

Users can manage digital assets, including ETH and tokens, in one place.
It connects directly to Ethereum and other blockchain networks via web3.js.
As a dApp Gateway:

Integrates seamlessly with platforms like OpenSea (NFTs), Uniswap (DeFi), and Decentraland (virtual worlds).
When accessing a dApp, MetaMask requests permission to connect your wallet.

Use Cases
Buying Tokens: Purchase ETH or other tokens via integrated services or external exchanges.
Trading: Swap tokens directly in MetaMask or through decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
Earning Yield: Stake assets in DeFi platforms to earn interest.
NFT Management: Store and interact with NFTs.
Cross-Chain Activities: Use custom RPCs to interact with non-Ethereum blockchains.
