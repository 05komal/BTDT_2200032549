MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet and a gateway to blockchain-based decentralized applications (dApps). It is commonly used for managing Ethereum-based tokens and interacting with smart contracts on Ethereum and other compatible blockchain networks. Below is a concise overview of what MetaMask is and how it functions:

**Key Features of MetaMask**
**1.**Wallet Functionality
Allows users to store, send, and receive Ethereum (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens.
Can also store NFTs (ERC-721 and ERC-1155).

**2.**dApp Interaction
Acts as a bridge to decentralized applications, enabling you to connect securely without sharing private keys.

**3.**Browser Extension & Mobile App
Available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave.
A mobile version is available for iOS and Android.

**4.**Network Support
Supports Ethereum by default but can be configured for other networks like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Avalanche.

**5.**Key Management
Generates and stores private keys locally on your device.
Access to your wallet is protected by a password, and the seed phrase is required for recovery.


**Use Cases**
**1.**Buying Tokens: Purchase ETH or other tokens via integrated services or external exchanges.
**2.**Trading: Swap tokens directly in MetaMask or through decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
**3.**Earning Yield: Stake assets in DeFi platforms to earn interest.
**4.**NFT Management: Store and interact with NFTs.
**5.**Cross-Chain Activities: Use custom RPCs to interact with non-Ethereum blockchains.
